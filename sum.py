#get numbers from list
l = [1,2,3]
n = len(l)
a = 0

# print sum using a for loop

	x = 0
	for item in l:

	   s += l[x]
	   x += 1
	   n -= 1

   if size == 0:
     return 0
   else:
     return numbers[size-1] + sum_recursive(numbers,size-1)

# total = sum4loop()   
# total = sumwhile()

total = sum_recursive(l,n) 

print total

# Program prints sum of integers in a list in 3 different methods. First method uses a for loop,
# second uses a while loop and the last one uses a recursive method
